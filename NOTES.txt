Fixed issue with circular dependency bug caused by too many includes.
Need to clean up codebase and refactor the global state.

to finish
	1. items
		a. food items
		b. usable items
		c. equipable
	2. item placement
		a. fillers.lua
		b. static items.
		c. static placed interactables.
	3. rooms.
		a. the designs for the tiles in the rooms
		b. the layout of the remaining rooms that need finishing
		c. the blackout of the rooms
		d. the doors
		e. the reasons for doors to open
	5. borders around containers.

1. add fire to the game
	s. finish off the logic
	DONE - a. add usable items (i.e. lighter, flint and tinder, matches)
	DONE - b. add smoke animation against cooker where fires can be lit.
	d. add heating on fire option to consumables
2. add fatigue and fatigue reduction
	a. sleep/blackouts are inevitable
	b. they send you to a random (sudo random, pick from a few) part of the map
	c. energy drinks, teas, etc should reduce these.
3. add delirium mechanics
	a. character following you
	b. whiteouts, i.e. whole screen goes white bar the character
	c. fuzzyness on the screen, darkening at the edges.
4. when searching containers add timer to each item so it doesn't instantly display
5. add speech bubble to MC, to show pain, tiredness, etc.
6. Split up map so I can finish off a section and get some testing on it.

Fires remaining work:
	1. Add heating on consumables
	DONE - 2. Add items to make fire with (flint and tinder, use paper)
		IN PROGRESS - i. Add make fire context menu option to all fire items
	3. Add timer to fires
	4. Add ability to check timer
	5. Add time to cook to consumables
		i. Add "cook" context menu item when fire in range.
	6. Add reason to stand by fire (boon, like reduced damage to wound, reduced delirium...etc)
	7. Coroutine to burn fires out after x amount of time.
