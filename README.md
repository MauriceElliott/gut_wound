# Gutwound

Gutwound is a survival game, that asks the question, how would you fair surviving in a twister turning towerblock in the apocalypse, while bleeding out from a Gutwound, and trying to get to the top to ascend before you die.

This was once a Picotron game, but after reviewing the existing codebase I have decided to do a rewrite and migrate over to Playdate.

### Pre-requisites

- PlaydateSDK
- Swift 6.2+

### Build

`./build.fish`
