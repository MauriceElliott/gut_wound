## Life and Death at the end of the World

### Introduction
This is a game I've been working on for a while now, the idea came from 1000+ hours of project zomboid, Kenshi, A short youtube video essay about Kowloon walled city, and The Road by Cormac McArthy.

As much as I want this game to be fun and enjoyable, I am under no illusion about my skill for making games, this is literally the first one, and I did 0 prototyping before embarking on fully fleshing it out. So if you find yourself enjoying the experience I am hugely glad, but know that it was not intentional.

My objective was to create the feeling Project Zomboid single player, as well as The Road gave me, a sense of despair, pain, loss, longing and survival. Loneliness, but a fighting spirit, a need to grasp every last breath you possibly can. This is not a game about dominating the last days of earth, but mearly another mean, heartless tendril of humanity doing its upmost to keep that last spark alive for as long as possible.

The most intersting part of developing this is the long drawn out system designs that go into a survival game, and as such, there are a lot of poorly thought out systems so feedback is welcome. I'm sure we'll end up pairing them back when we get close to the end.

If you see improvements that could be made, please open an issue.
