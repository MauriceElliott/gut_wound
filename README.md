## Gutwound

This is a game I've been working on for a while now, the idea came from 1000+ hours of project zomboid, Kenshi, A short youtube video essay about Kowloon walled city, and The Road by Cormac McArthy. It also takes some inspiration from Rain World. I have been playing games my whole life, but never thought I'd have the ability to make one. I feel extremely blessed to live in a time where the drive and ability to learn are all that is required.
